## Keylogger
- This is a simple python keylogger script which I built using [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) library 
- This records the keystrokes of the system and after a certain limit it will send the key log file to the attacker
- This can be easily indentified by windows defender so try this in the absence of windows defender
## Requirements
- This requires python>=3.9
- Pynput library [command](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/)
- smpt library inbuilt
- datetime library inbuilt
- subprocess library inbuilt 
## Alterations 
- In your keylogger.py file just set your credentials in the field of (mail,pass,client)
- And you can use [auto-py-to-exe](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/) to convert the py file to exe and make it use
